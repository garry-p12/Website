# 🎉 Deployment Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Built the React Portfolio** - Production-ready build created
2. **Deployed to gh-pages branch** - Static site files are live
3. **Pushed source code to main** - Your React code is now in the repository

## 🌐 Next Step: Configure GitHub Pages

Your portfolio is deployed to the `gh-pages` branch, but you need to configure GitHub Pages to use it:

### Quick Setup (2 minutes):

1. Visit: https://github.com/garry-p12/Portfolio/settings/pages
2. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Branch**: `gh-pages`
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
3. Click **Save**

Your portfolio will be live at: **https://garry-p12.github.io/Portfolio/**

⏱️ **Note**: It may take 2-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to update after configuration.

## 📦 What's Deployed

## 🔄 Updating Your Portfolio
