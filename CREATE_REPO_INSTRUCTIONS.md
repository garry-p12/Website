# ðŸš€ Create New Repository & Deploy

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `modern-portfolio`
3. Description: `Modern React Portfolio with Interactive Code Background`
4. Choose: **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **Create repository**

## Step 2: After Creating the Repo

Once you've created the repo, let me know and I'll push the code and deploy it!

Alternatively, you can run these commands yourself:

```bash
cd Portfolio-React
git push -u origin main
npm run deploy
```

Then configure GitHub Pages to use the `gh-pages` branch.

**Note**: The repository name will be `modern-portfolio`, so your site will be live at:
**https://garry-p12.github.io/modern-portfolio/**
